    <!-- OVERVIEW -->
    <section id="overview">
      <h2>Overview: Why Communication Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Business lives and breathes through communication. Good communicators
        make good professionals, and confident communication helps you:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Look professional in emails, memos, and messages.</li>
        <li>Lead meetings and presentations without losing your audience.</li>
        <li>Use visuals that support your message instead of distracting from it.</li>
        <li>Listen well so people feel heard and respected.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our video shows “wrong way” vs. “better way” communication. This manual
        explains the concepts behind those scenes and gives you practical tips
        you can use at school, at work, and in internships.
      </p>
      <div class="tip">
        <strong>Big idea:</strong> Communicating with confidence is not about
        being perfect. It’s about being clear, respectful, and prepared.
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- WRITING -->
    <section id="writing">
      <h2>1. Communicating in Writing</h2>
      <p>
        Writing skills matter in every job. Good writers tend to become leaders
        because they can explain ideas clearly and professionally.
      </p>

      <h3>1.1 Think Before You Write</h3>
      <p>Before you start typing, ask yourself:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>What do I want to say?</strong> What is my main point?</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Should this be in writing?</strong> Writing is best when:
          <ul>
            <li>You need a permanent record.</li>
            <li>You’re sending it to many people.</li>
            <li>The information is detailed or complicated.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          A quick conversation is better when it’s sensitive, simple, or when
          you’re not clear yet on what you should say.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>1.2 Think While You Write</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Be clear.</strong> Your reader should not have to guess.</li>
        <li><strong>Be considerate.</strong> Respect the reader’s time and feelings.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Be correct.</strong> Use spell-check and reread for grammar and
          facts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Be logical.</strong> Use transitions so your ideas flow from
          one to the next.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Keep it simple.</strong> Short, simple words and short sentences
          are easiest to understand.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>1.3 After You Write: Revise</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Remove extra words and off-topic details.</li>
        <li>Add missing details your reader needs.</li>
        <li>Check that your tone is professional and positive.</li>
        <li>Fix spelling, grammar, and factual errors.</li>
        <li>
          For important messages, ask someone else to quickly read it if
          possible.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>1.4 Email Basics (Scene 1 – “The Confusing Email”)</h3>
      <p>
        In the video, “Jamie” sends a messy email and “Alex” is confused. That
        scene shows what happens when we skip the steps above.
      </p>

      <div class="bad-example">
        <strong>Bad example email:</strong><br />
        Subject: Need This Now!!!<br />
        “Hey can u fix this thing from last week? Idk the number but it’s
        important.”
      </div>

      <div class="good-example">
        <strong>Better example email:</strong><br />
        Subject: Follow-Up on Expense Report – Action by Friday<br />
        “Hi Alex, could you please review the expense report from last week
        (invoice #458)? I just need your sign-off by Friday. Thank you!”
      </div>

      <p class="scene-link">
        How it connects to the chapter: clear subject line, specific details,
        polite tone, and a clear deadline.
      </p>

      <div class="tip">
        <strong>Quick rule for emails:</strong> Clear subject line + specific
        request + deadline + polite tone.
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- SPEAKING -->
    <section id="speaking">
      <h2>2. Speaking with Confidence</h2>
      <p>
        To speak confidently, preparation is the key. You are the “expert” in
        that moment, and the audience wants you to succeed.
      </p>

      <h3>2.1 Do Your Homework</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Learn about your audience: What do they already know? What might be
          confusing or new to them?
        </li>
        <li>
          Gather your data: facts, examples, and stories to support your main
          points.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.2 A Simple Formula for a Speech</h3>
      <p>The text gives a clear formula:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Tell them what you’ll tell them.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tell them.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tell them what you told them.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In other words: introduce your main points, explain them, and then
        review them briefly at the end.
      </p>

      <h3>2.3 Build a Better Presentation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep it short and focused; people tune out after 15–20 minutes.</li>
        <li>
          Keep the audience engaged:
          <ul>
            <li>Ask for a show of hands.</li>
            <li>Ask rhetorical questions (“Have you ever…?”).</li>
            <li>Repeat key points after you explain them.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Don’t give them something long to read while you’re talking.</li>
        <li>Use appropriate, good-taste humor when it fits.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.4 During Your Presentation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Dress one level more professional than your audience.</li>
        <li>Introduce yourself or arrange to be introduced.</li>
        <li>Don’t rush; take a breath before you begin.</li>
        <li>Talk slowly enough that people can follow you. Pause often.</li>
        <li>Speak loudly enough for the room, not just the front row.</li>
        <li>Use your face, hands, and voice to show energy and emotion.</li>
        <li>Drop filler words like “um” and “like” — just pause instead.</li>
        <li>
          Make eye contact with individuals rather than staring at your notes or
          the screen.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don’t read your whole speech word-for-word. Glance at notes instead.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.5 Scene 2 – “The Awkward Meeting”</h3>
      <p>
        In our video, “Taylor” reads from a paper with no eye contact and
        everyone zones out. Then, in the “better way,” Taylor looks up, speaks
        naturally, and connects with the group.
      </p>
      <div class="tip">
        <strong>Key lesson:</strong> People don’t just listen to your words;
        they react to your eye contact, tone, and body language.
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- VISUALS -->
    <section id="visuals">
      <h2>3. Presenting Ideas Visually</h2>
      <p>
        Visual aids can clarify your message, emphasize key points, keep people
        paying attention, and make you look more prepared — if you use them
        correctly.
      </p>

      <h3>3.1 Visuals Must Have a Purpose</h3>
      <p>Use visuals to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Show trends or comparisons with charts and graphs.</li>
        <li>
          Explain abstract concepts (like “trust,” “teamwork,” or “freedom”).
        </li>
        <li>Show pictures of people, places, or products.</li>
        <li>Walk people through a complicated process.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3.2 The “Visual Overload” Problem (Scene 3)</h3>
      <p>
        In the video, “Chris” shows a slide packed with tiny text and random
        clip art. No one can follow it.
      </p>

      <div class="bad-example">
        <strong>What went wrong:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Too much text on one slide.</li>
          <li>Font is too small to read.</li>
          <li>Too many distracting images and clutter.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="good-example">
        <strong>Better visual approach:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>1 simple title.</li>
          <li>3 main bullet points or a single clear chart/graph.</li>
          <li>Plenty of empty space so the slide feels clean.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3>3.3 Visual “Do’s and Don’ts”</h3>
      <h4>Do:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Use charts and graphs to explain data clearly.</li>
        <li>Give handouts if there is a lot of information to remember.</li>
        <li>
          Arrive early, test your equipment, and have a backup plan if
          something fails.
        </li>
        <li>Speak to your audience, not to the screen.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Don’t:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Talk while everyone is trying to read a long slide.</li>
        <li>Dump an entire list on screen at once if you can reveal it slowly.</li>
        <li>Leave the room dark for too long — people get sleepy.</li>
        <li>Use a visual just to show off technology.</li>
        <li>
          Put a visual up long before you discuss it or leave it up after you’ve
          moved on.
        </li>
        <li>Turn your back and talk to the slide instead of the group.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- LISTENING -->
    <section id="listening">
      <h2>4. Listening: The Other Half of Communication</h2>
      <p>
        Good communication is not just talking — it’s listening. People decide
        if they trust you based on how well you listen.
      </p>

      <h3>4.1 Scene 4 – “The Listening Problem”</h3>
      <p>
        In the video, “Jordan” cuts people off and pushes only their own idea.
        In the “better way,” Jordan listens first and then builds on the other
        person’s idea.
      </p>

      <h3>4.2 How to Listen with Confidence</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Let the other person finish before you respond.</li>
        <li>Show you’re listening by nodding and using short responses (“I see.”).</li>
        <li>Ask clarifying questions instead of assuming.</li>
        <li>Summarize what you heard: “So you’re saying that…”</li>
        <li>Be open to combining ideas instead of “my way vs. your way.”</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="tip">
        <strong>Listening rule:</strong> If people feel heard, they are more
        likely to hear you.
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- WORD CHOICE -->
    <section id="word-choice">
      <h2>5. Choosing the Right Words</h2>
      <p>Words are powerful tools. In business, we use several kinds of words:</p>

      <h3>5.1 Types of Business Words</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Jargon:</strong> Job-specific terms (for example, “bull
          market”). Helpful with insiders, confusing to others.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Technical words:</strong> Scientific or specialized terms used
          accurately in that field.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Vogue words:</strong> Trendy phrases (like “24/7” instead of
          “we never close”).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Euphemisms:</strong> Softer words used instead of harsh ones
          (like “sanitary engineer” for “garbage collector”).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Acronyms:</strong> Words formed from initials (like “AWOL” or
          “E.R.”).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5.2 Words to Avoid at Work</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Slang:</strong> Very informal words that not everyone
          understands the same way.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Filler expressions:</strong> “Like,” “you know,” “basically,”
          when they don’t add meaning.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Vulgar or offensive language:</strong> Swearing and insults
          damage your professional image.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <div class="tip">
        <strong>Simple rule:</strong> Use everyday, respectful language that
        anyone in the room can understand.
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- PROBLEM SOLVING -->
    <section id="problem-solving">
      <h2>6. Two Ways to Solve Communication Problems</h2>
      <p>
        When communication breaks down, you can use both critical thinking and
        creative thinking to fix it.
      </p>

      <h3>6.1 Critical Thinking</h3>
      <p>Critical thinking is logical and step-by-step. You:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Focus on the problem (“What exactly is going wrong?”).</li>
        <li>Break it into parts.</li>
        <li>Gather and assess information.</li>
        <li>Consider possible solutions and pick the best one.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6.2 Creative Thinking</h3>
      <p>Creative thinking is more intuitive and open-ended. You:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Look at the problem from a different angle.</li>
        <li>Stay open to surprising ideas and inspiration.</li>
        <li>Brainstorm without judging ideas too quickly.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Both approaches are valuable. You’ll often get the best solution when
        you use them together.

      <h2>8. How This Manual Connects to Our Training Video</h2>
      <p>
        Our video, <em>“Communicate with Confidence – The Right Way at Work,”</em>
        uses short scenes to show the concepts from this chapter in action.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Trailer:</strong> Shows “miscommunication, confusion, chaos”
          to remind us why this topic matters.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Scene 1 – The Confusing Email:</strong> Connects to
          <em>Communicating in Writing</em> and email best practices.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Scene 2 – The Awkward Meeting:</strong> Shows what happens
          when you read from notes and avoid eye contact; connects to
          <em>Speaking with Confidence</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Scene 3 – The Visual Overload:</strong> Links directly to
          <em>Presenting Ideas Visually</em> and the do’s and don’ts for slides.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Scene 4 – The Listening Problem:</strong> Emphasizes that
          listening is part of communication, not separate from it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Scene 5 – Wrap-Up:</strong> Lines like “Think before you
          write,” “Speak clearly and confidently,” “Keep visuals simple,” and
          “Listen before you respond” summarize the core points of this manual.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Use this manual as a reference while you watch the video or scan the QR
        code. The goal is that what we say in the video matches what you can
        read here, so everything feels consistent and practical.
